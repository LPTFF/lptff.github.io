    "summary": "Strange metals are a class of materials that behave differently from ordinary metals and challenge existing theories of electricity. Recent research suggests that in these materials, electrons lose their individuality and may act as a collective \"soup\" rather than distinct particles. Understanding strange metals could lead to breakthroughs in superconductivity and new ways to think about electricity.",
